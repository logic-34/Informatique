./mygrep regex [file] (optional, default : stdin)

Look for any string in [file] matching the format of regex and print them in stdout

Example : ./mygrep "a@.*@b" "mydoc.txt" will print every line in mydoc.txt which start by a and end by b

Format of regex :
"" -> empty line
"a" -> line which contains only "a"
"[R]?" -> line which matches R or are empty
"[R]*" -> line which matches R concatened to itself any number of time (including 0)
"[R]+" -> line which matches R concatened to itself any number of time (at least 1)
"[R1][R2]|" -> line which matches R1 or R2
"[R1][R2]@" -> line which matches R2 concatened to R1

Type \ in front of an operator to count it as a character
